# Workout Tracker Implementation Tasks

Generated from `requirements-workout-tracker.md` and `research-workout-tracker.md`

## Relevant Files

### Laravel Playground Tool Structure (ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION)
- `resources/js/pages/Playground/Tools/WorkoutTracker.vue` - **‚úÖ COMPLETED** - Single integrated component with all functionality
- `resources/js/composables/useWorkoutData.ts` - **‚úÖ COMPLETED** - Auto-save and data management logic
- `resources/js/types/workout.ts` - **‚úÖ COMPLETED** - TypeScript interfaces for workout data
- `resources/js/components/ui/combobox/` - **‚úÖ COMPLETED** - shadcn-vue combobox components (auto-generated)

### Laravel Backend (ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION)
- `app/Http/Controllers/PlaygroundController.php` - **‚úÖ COMPLETED** - Updated with workout tracker placeholder
- `database/seeders/PlaygroundToolSeeder.php` - **‚úÖ COMPLETED** - Workout tracker tool entry added
- `tailwind.config.js` - **‚úÖ COMPLETED** - Empty config file for shadcn-vue compatibility

### Development & Tooling (COMPLETED)
- `components.json` - **‚úÖ COMPLETED** - Fixed for Tailwind v4 compatibility
- `package.json` - **‚úÖ COMPLETED** - Updated dependencies

### Testing & Quality (PENDING)
- `tests/Feature/WorkoutTrackerTest.php` - **‚è≥ PENDING** - Feature tests for workout functionality
- `tests/Feature/Playwright/WorkoutTrackerE2E.spec.js` - **‚è≥ PENDING** - E2E mobile testing

### Bug Fixes (COMPLETED)
- **‚úÖ FIXED** - Vite module resolution error for WorkoutTracker.vue page
- **‚úÖ FIXED** - Runtime error: undefined exercises.value in sortedExercises computed property
- **‚úÖ FIXED** - Template error: undefined exercises.length check in empty state
- **‚úÖ FIXED** - Added null safety checks throughout useWorkoutData composable
- **‚úÖ FIXED** - TypeScript compilation passes with all null safety improvements

**Implementation Note:** We chose an integrated single-component approach rather than separate components for faster development and better user experience. All functionality is contained within `WorkoutTracker.vue` with proper separation of concerns via composables.

## Risk Mitigation Notes

### Low Confidence Tasks (6-7/10)
- **Task 4.6**: Skeleton loading requires careful UX design - reference existing playground tool patterns
- **Task 5.4**: Mobile E2E testing needs real device validation beyond browser DevTools
- **Task 2.4**: Exercise sorting algorithm complexity may impact performance with large datasets

### Anti-Pattern Warnings
- **Avoid excessive API calls**: Ensure 500ms debounce is properly implemented in auto-save
- **Don't use raw database queries**: Leverage existing UserToolData model and JSON storage
- **Avoid custom NumberField implementations**: Use shadcn-vue NumberField component consistently

### Performance Considerations
- **Task 3.6**: Auto-save visual feedback should not block UI interactions
- **Task 4.2**: Historical data pagination essential for users with extensive workout history
- **Task 4.5**: Lazy loading critical for mobile performance with large JSON datasets

## Standards to Follow

- Target audience: Junior developer familiar with Vue.js/Laravel/TypeScript stack
- Use British English throughout (colour, centre, realise)
- Follow existing Laravel playground tool patterns
- Use Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup>` syntax
- Leverage shadcn-vue component library for consistency
- Implement mobile-first design with Tailwind CSS v4
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- All data scoped to authenticated user via existing auth system
- Use existing `UserToolData.saved_data` JSON storage pattern
- Follow Laravel 12 file structure conventions
